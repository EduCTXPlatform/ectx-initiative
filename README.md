## Welcome to GitHub Pages

The EduCTX blockchain platform rests on the idea that all globally distributed HEIs join forces together in order to build an efficient, simplified, ubiquitous solution for a student's credit assignment, while eliminating language and administrative obstacles which arise when dealing with credit transfers and certification on a broader or global scale. Therefore, we invite anyone interested to join the EduCTX initiative (more information is available at eductx.org), so that the EduCTX idea can be further discussed and developed. 
We also encourage all HEIs, especially those already having the ECTS accredited system, to join the EduCTX blockchain network, thus helping spread and add to the security of the network. For further information, please contact us at: eductx@um.si.
